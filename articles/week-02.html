        <h3>Week 02: From Visibility to Velocity – Why Dashboards Matter in Transport</h3>
        <p>
          Real-time visibility is no longer a luxury in fleet operations—it's a necessity. But visibility alone isn’t enough. Without action-oriented data, your dashboard is just a screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          At PrimeChain Solutions, we build dashboards that move beyond tracking. Our tools highlight idle trucks, show route performance, track diesel spend, and even flag underperforming contracts—all in one view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built by professionals who’ve been in the trenches of fleet operations, our dashboards are designed to surface the right decisions at the right time. You don’t just see what’s happening—you know what to do next.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're still managing transport operations through fragmented tools and gut feel, it's time to upgrade. Control towers aren’t just for enterprise players anymore.
