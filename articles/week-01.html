        <h3>Week 01: The Real Cost of Manual Processes in Small Supply Chains</h3>
        <p>
          Many growing businesses unknowingly carry the weight of inefficiency. Manual spreadsheets, paper slips, and WhatsApp coordination may get the job done—but at what cost?
        </p>
        <p>
          At PrimeChain Solutions, we’ve seen firsthand how operational blind spots lead to stockouts, delayed orders, and underutilized fleets. These issues don’t just affect productivity—they limit growth potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          From our beginnings in warehousing and transport, we’ve helped businesses evolve by integrating automation and real-time dashboards that offer decision clarity. When you stop managing your supply chain by reaction and start managing it by design, everything changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The real cost isn’t just in time wasted; it’s in value lost. Don’t let outdated processes hold your business back. Let’s automate the heavy lifting, so your team can focus on what matters most—growing your business.
